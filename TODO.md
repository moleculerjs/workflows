# TODO

- [x] Scheduling
  - [x] Cron
  - [x] endDate
  - [ ] count of executions
  - [x] Remove repeated job by jobId
  - [ ] 
- [ ] Job error handling (if it crashed the job, don't save to events, to avoid replaying crasher error)
- [x] Get workflow state
- [ ] jobId collision policy
  - [ ] reject
  - [ ] skip
  - [ ] rerun
- [ ] job timeout handling
- [ ] wait for result `const result = await broker.wf.run(...).promise()`
  - [ ] job will run on other nodes, so it should subscribe for `job.finished` Redis msg and resolve or reject the stored promise.
- [ ] Signal wait timeout `WfSignalTimeoutError`
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] Better processing delayed/failed job (without waiting for maintenance time)
- [ ] Performance improvement
- [ ] Concurrent job running
- [ ] Job parameter validation
- [ ] ~~ctx.opts~~
  - [ ] ~~`beforeSetState`~~
  - [ ] ~~`afterSetState`~~
- [ ] Metrics
- [ ] Tracing
- [ ] maxStalledCount - limit the number of putting back the stalled job to wait. (0 means, never, null means everytime)
- [ ] Events:
  - [ ] - `job.created`
  - [ ] - `job.started`
  - [ ] - `job.stalled`
  - [ ] - `job.finished`
  - [ ] - `job.completed`
  - [ ] - `job.failed`
